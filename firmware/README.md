# Firmware development

The firmware baseline is ESP-IDF 6.0.2 with LVGL locked to the 9.4 release line. Activate the matching ESP-IDF environment before using the repository tools.

## Build variants

Development builds enable the machine-readable diagnostics consumed by HIL tests. At
startup they wait up to ten seconds for the harness's `DECK_HIL_READY` serial handshake
before emitting the one-shot event, so a post-flash monitor cannot race the event:

```bash
./tools/idf.sh dev build
```

Release builds disable both the development diagnostic channel and the ESP-IDF console:

```bash
./tools/idf.sh release build
```

Each variant owns an isolated generated `sdkconfig` and build directory. The committed `sdkconfig.defaults` files are the source of truth; generated configuration and managed components are not versioned.

## Host tests

```bash
./tools/test_host.sh
```

Host tests exercise firmware behavior through public C-compatible interfaces and replay captured HIL console data without requiring a Deck.

## Safe boot smoke test

With exactly one Deck connected and its serial port free:

1. Hold **BOOT**, power-cycle the Deck, then release **BOOT**. This board requires that
   physical action to enter the ROM download mode over its built-in USB Serial/JTAG port.
2. Run:

```bash
./tools/hil_boot_smoke.sh /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

The script builds, flashes only the generated bootloader/partition/application regions,
performs a software-watchdog reset, and waits for one `boot_ok` JSON Line. It never
erases the whole Flash, writes eFuses, or changes irreversible security settings.
